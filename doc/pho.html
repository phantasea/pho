<h1>pho: View and annotate multiple images</h1>

<i><a href="../../mailme.html">...Akkana</a></i>

<p>
<b>pho</b> (pronounced like the first syllable in "photo")
is a lightweight program for viewing large numbers of
images quickly, rotating or deleting some,
and making notes about what to do with each image --
for instance, for going through hundreds of
images after uploading them from a digital camera.

<p>
The current version is <b> pho 0.9.8.</b>
<br>
To get it, <a href="#download">skip to the download section.</a>

<p>
You can now customize the command called up with the 'g' key.
It defaults to gimp (not gimp-remote as in previous pho versions),
but you can call any program you like,
e.g. view the current image in firefox with
<code>export PHO_CMD="firefox %s"</code> --
don't forget the %s for the filename!

<p>
BSD users: pho should build on *BSD now as of 0.9.6-pre2.
If it doesn't, please let me know.

<p>
Other changes include major work on scaling modes. Double and half size
mode now behave differently depending on whether you're in normal or
full size mode, and the scaling factor (e.g. half size) is remembered
as you go from image to image.

<p>
<b>Warning: I've swapped the meanings of f and F. I found that I
use full size mode all the time, whereas I seldom use full screen,
and when I do, I use it once at the beginning of a session (e.g.
to view a bunch of cartoons scaled up). So it makes more sense
to have full size on f (easier to type).</b>

<p>
I've also done quite a bit of performance work, to reduce the number
of redraws, speed up rotates, and reduce the number of times Pho has to
re-read the file on disk.

<h2>How to use pho</h2>

Usage: pho *.jpg (or whatever).<br>
It will show the first image, scaled for your screen if needed.
Then the following keys work:
<dl>
<dt>space                   <dd>Go to next image.
<dt>backspace, -            <dd>Go to previous image.
<dt>r, t, right-arrow       <dd>Rotate right (clockwise). 
<dt>R, T, l, L, left-arrow  <dd>Rotate left (counter-clockwise).
<dt>up-arrow                <dd>Rotate 180 degrees.
<dt>home                    <dd>Go back to the first image.
<dt>d                 <dd>Bring up a delete dialog (another d deletes the file)
<dt>i                       <dd>Show information about the image
                                (includes EXIF info and JPEG comment, if any).
<dt>0-9                     <dd>Add this image to the appropriate list.
<dt>f                       <dd>Toggle in and out of "full size mode"
      (show the image at its native size, even if that's too big
       to fit on screen)
<dt>F                       <dd>Toggle in and out of "full screen mode"
      (make the image as big as it can be and still fit on the screen).
<dt>p                       <dd>Toggle in and out of Presentation Mode
      (full screen, no mouse or window borders)
<dt>-, /                    <dd>Zoom out, to half size
<dt>+, =, *                 <dd>Zoom in, to double size
<td>o                       <dd>Pop up a file selector to change the working
                                file list (New replaces all the old images,
                                Add just adds new files to the list)
<dt>g                       <dd>Run gimp on this image
    (or set PHO_REMOTE to an alternate command).
<dt>q                       <dd>Quit.
</dl>

<p>
Pho will remember the correct (last shown) rotation for each image.
When it exits (either because the last image was viewed or because
the user typed q), it will print out the images that need to be
rotated and deleted (it does not actually change the files on disk),
and the images which were added to numbered lists.
For example, I might press 1 on all the photos I want to save for
a web page, 2 on the couple of photos that need additional editing
in gimp, and 3 on the photos I want to save as desktop backgrounds.

<h3>Modes</h3>

<h4>Presentation mode</h4>

<p>
Normally, Pho shows images in its own window, and it tries hard to
move and resize the window as needed to keep the window the right size
and  over the mouse.
<p>
Presentation mode (-p) makes pho fullscreen.
It also enables dragging with the middle mouse button to pan in the image.
By default, pho will scale images to fit the screen, so there's no
need to pan; but if you zoom in, either with f (full size) or +
(double size), you may want a way to move around in the image.
 (In non-presentation mode, the image is in its own window, so you
can move the window using your window manager.)
Pho's author uses presentation mode as her default: <code>PHO_ARGS=-p</code>
and runs <code>pho -P</code> in the rare cases where she doesn't want
fullscreen.

<h4>Slideshow mode</h4>
<p>
There's also a new slideshow mode, where you specify the interval in seconds
(e.g. pho -p -s5 for a 5-second delay between images).
You can use this for a screensaver, or just to go through slides
automatically. Hitting the spacebar cancels slideshow mode.

<h4>Keywords mode</h4>
<p>
Keywords mode gives you an easy way to annotate a directory of images
with strings. You can type in phrases for each note, and you can have
up to 31 notes now.
You can also type in a unique image comment for each
image. Comments aren't tied to the numbered image flags -- each image
has its own comment.
<p>
Keywords and comments are available in every pho mode (via the info dialog:
type i in any image to see current keywords and comment). Keywords mode
just gives better access to this.
However, you may find <a href="https://github.com/akkana/metapho">metapho</a>
to be a better way to mange keywords.

<h2>Why another image viewer?  Surely there are plenty of those?</h2>

<p>
I used to use xv for paging through images -- it's quite a good
viewing program -- but it had a few features which annoyed me.  For
example, it creates a directory called .xvpics in every directory it touches;
and if an image has to be resized to fit the screen, and after that
you save it (perhaps after rotating it), it saves at the smaller size
and boom, there goes your high-res image.

<p>
But, more important, there were a few extra things I needed.
During image triage, I need to be able to do a few things quickly:
<ul>
<li>Rotate images by multiples of 90 degrees, and remember the rotations.
<li>Delete bad images.
<li>Copy a few of the best horizontals to my Backgrounds (wallpaper) directory.
<li>Note which images I might want to put on a web page (after resizing).
</ul>
With xv, I found that I was writing these lists on paper, or trying
to keep track of them in my head.  That's dumb!  Why not make the
computer do that work?  So I did.

<p>
Since I wrote pho several years ago, I keep hearing about other
image viewers, and thinking maybe pho was redundant.  But I recently
did a search, and couldn't come up with any other image viewers that
are similarly efficient for paging through large collections of
images.  So I guess I'll keep maintaining pho!

<p>
Pho can read any format supported by gdk-pixbuf.  I haven't found a
list of those formats anywhere, but it seems to be substantial.
The only format I've hit so far that it doesn't read is photocd.
You can convert those to other formats using the ImageMagick utility.

<p>
Pho can delete images on disk, but it doesn't save rotated images.
I use my <a href="../imagebatch/">imagebatch</a> scripts for that,
or you can use a commandline utility like <a
href="http://imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>
(which is what my imagebatch scripts use under the hood).

<p>
<b>Mac users:</b>
Pho definitely does work on Mac OS X
if you have the appropriate gtk/gdk headers and libraries
(my husband uses it).
I've only seen it used as an X11 application, but in theory
it should be able to run with the new experimental native gtk
libraries too.

<p>
<h3>Dependencies:</h3>
pho uses the gtk+-2.0 libraries (though if it can't find them, 
it can run slightly less functionally with gtk1 and gdk-pixbuf).
You may need to edit the Makefile if your system has these libraries
installed in different place from my system (sorry, no autoconf yet).
<p>
To compile pho, you'll need a compiler, GTK, and all the libraries
it depends on. For example, on Ubuntu, this command should get you
what you need:
<pre>
aptitude install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev
</pre>

<p>
If you like pho, or if you think it's promising but there's some
feature it really needs ... <a href="../../mailme.html">let me know!</a>
