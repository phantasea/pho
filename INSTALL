BUILDING AND INSTALLING pho

REQUIREMENTS:
pho uses the gdk_pixbuf library for reading, scaling, and displaying
images. So you will need gdk-pixbuf installed in order to run pho.
To compile it, you will also need gdk-pixbuf-devel.
The home for gdk_pixbuf is:
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gdk-pixbuf/index.html

BUILDING:
To build pho, type: make
To install the binary and manual page, type (as root): make install

The current Makefile has been tested on Redhat 7.3 and Debian Woody,
and assumes gtk 1.2 (and gtk-devel) as well as gdk-pixbuf 1.0.
You may need to edit the Makefile on some other systems,
or to use other versions of gtk.
Sorry, there is no configure script for it yet.
Feel free to contact me if you have any problems building pho.
